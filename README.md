# Phone Cluster

My lightweight, cozy little server–client system for experimenting with a phone-based cluster.

## What is this?

This project is a tiny server + client setup designed for:
- phones running Termux
- mixed environments (Arch / Ubuntu / Android)

## Project layout

 - server/ # Flask-based server
 - client/ # Simple HTTP client
 - clusterctl/ # Install / uninstall manager
 - scripts/ # Thin shell wrappers
 - config/ # Example config files
